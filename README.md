# Robot Vacuum Cleaner
 A simulation of robotic vacuum in Python

The agent will check if there is an dirty spot in it's row.
If there is, it will check if the dirty spot is from the left or right of it
and will move accordingly to this. If there is no dirty spot = means the whole row is clear,
it will move down to the next row.
The agent's behavior is rational because if there is a clean row it will just keep moving forward (down)
